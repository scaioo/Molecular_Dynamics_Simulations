GROMACS reminds you: "When I got my first job as a programmer there were quite a number of women doing programming because there was no computer science education and people were hired from many different fields if it seemed like they could do the work. It was better then, probably, in terms of proportions, not necessarily in women being paid as much as men and so forth, but definitely, there were women around." (Barbara Liskov)
