# Molecular Dynamics Simulations with GROMACS

This repository contains a series of exercises to learn and apply key molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques using **GROMACS**, one of the most popular MD simulation packages.

The exercises progressively cover fundamental and advanced topics in MD, including temperature and pressure coupling, system equilibration, free energy calculations, and advanced analysis methods.
